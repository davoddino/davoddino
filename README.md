# 👋 Hi, I'm David Cavada

🎓 *Computer Science student at the University of Verona (2022–2025)*  
Driven by curiosity, creation, and quiet persistence.  
I explore the intersection between science, technology, and creativity — building systems that connect intelligence, perception, and real-world impact.

## 🌍 What I Do

### 🎓 Education and Research
- **Bachelor’s in Computer Science**, University of Verona  
  Learned programming from scratch and grew into a complete developer, moving from algorithms to operating systems, databases, and AI.  
  My **thesis** focused on *forecasting tourist flows* using machine learning models and synthetic data, under the guidance of *Sara Migliorini*, *Elisa Quintarelli*, and *Alessandro Farinelli*.

- **Quantum Physics and AI**  
  Explored how superposition, entanglement, and quantum inference connect to computation, algorithms, and philosophy.

- **Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain**  
  Studied agent architectures, policy learning, and smart contracts on Ethereum to understand how logic and trust emerge in code.

### 🧠 Projects and Engineering
- **ScaleIQ** · Collaboration with *Cineca* and the *Leonardo Supercomputer*  
  Building an intelligent system that automates code deployment, compilation, and execution on HPC clusters — a *Codex for supercomputers* that saves researchers time by understanding repositories, environments, and logs.

- **VisualAnchors for Godot** · [GitHub ↗](https://github.com/davoddino/visualanchors)  
  Plugin for **Meta Quest 3** and **Godot Engine** enabling real-world anchoring through QR-code detection, OpenCV pose estimation, and XR integration.  
  It merges computer vision, geometry, and spatial computing into a single workflow.

- **SFSCON Hackathon Winner (2022)**  
  Developed an autonomous logistics system for hotels using Arduino, an app for staff, and a management dashboard — blending IoT, teamwork, and practical design.

- **Suggesto S.r.l. Internship**  
  Created an AI-driven video pipeline using *Whisper* and *vLLM* with *Qwen 3.5* to automate transcription, title generation, and summarization across hundreds of videos.

- **Wellround Internship**  
  Worked on full-stack systems: LLM agents, dashboards for universities and students, REST/GraphQL APIs, and PostgreSQL databases.  
  Helped design scalable data flows and agent orchestration in a fast-paced startup environment.

### 💻 Technical Skills
- **Languages**: C, C++, Assembly, Python, Java, JavaScript, Dart, GDScript  
- **GPU Programming**: CUDA, ROCm  
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Godot Engine, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, vLLM, OpenCV, Whisper  
- **Focus Areas**: AI systems, HPC automation, XR interfaces, GPU computing, and code efficiency.

### ☘️ Earlier Experience
- **Exchange Year in Ireland (2021–2022)**  
  Graduated with the *Leaving Certificate*, deepened my English fluency, and grew through culture, study, and sport.  
  Discovered how thinking in another language changes the way you reason and connect ideas.

## 💭 Philosophy
I like to learn quietly and build things that make sense — systems that feel alive, that organize complexity, that help others work faster or think deeper.  
Technology for me is a language for understanding reality.
